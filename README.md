### Superior126

There once was a GitHub user named Superior126
Who had a passion for coding and was very keen
He wrote many programs in Python and js
And shared them with others for everyone to see
He was always learning new skills and techniques
And never gave up when he faced any critiques
He was a humble and friendly developer indeed
And always helped others when they were in need
Superior126 was a GitHub star, no doubt
And everyone admired what he was about
